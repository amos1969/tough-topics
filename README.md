# Teaching the Tough Topics

Some files for the Teaching the Tough Topics at A Level Computer Science that I'm, teaching at the National STEM Centre,
in York.

# Order of the day
- Authorisation and validation
- Recursion and iteration, including a look at list comprehensions and generators
- Creating user defined data structures by combining existing ones, using import effectively and creating your own
module from which to import functions and attributes
