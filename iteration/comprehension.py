# List comprehension
squares = [i*i for i in range(10)]

# A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more
# for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of
# the for and if clauses which follow it.
